# Neural Network in Python

## A simple implementation for learning purposes

#### This neural network was built based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh">Daniel Shiffman's playlist</a> about Neural Networks and the XOR problem.

The Neural Network uses the sigmoid function as the activation function, and supports multiple layers. Despite the use of this Neural Network being impractical, it can have a decent precision in simple XOR problem, and a low-average in MNIST dataset.
